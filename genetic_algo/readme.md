- `--crossover_nodes` : Percentage of nodes want to be swapped across different populations
- `--mutation_nodes` : Number of ndoes want to be swapped at the mutations stage
- `--populationsize` : Number of solutions
- `--iteration` : Number of iterations
- `--function` : Optimization function of genetic algorithm
